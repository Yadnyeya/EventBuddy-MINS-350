# Site Map Instructions

## Hand-Drawn Site Map Requirements

You need to create a **hand-drawn site map** showing all major page views/screens for the EventBuddy application. This must be drawn by hand (not digitally created) and then scanned or photographed.

### Site Map Structure Requirements:
- **Hierarchical Layout**: Must be organized like a tree structure (not a mind map)
- **Labeled Boxes**: One box for each screen/page
- **Arrows**: Show navigation flow between screens
- **Annotations**: Brief notes for key details

### Pages to Include:

#### Authentication Flow
- **Landing Page** → "Welcome to EventBuddy"
- **Login Page** → "User login form"
- **Registration Page** → "New user signup"
- **Password Reset Page** → "Forgot password"

#### Main Application Flow
- **Dashboard/Home** → "Main landing after login"

#### Special Flows
